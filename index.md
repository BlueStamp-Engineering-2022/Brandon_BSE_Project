# Facial Recognition Door Lock
This door lock is able to recognise people that arrive at the front of your door. It will then take a photo and send it to my email. Read more to find out how I did it!

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is my modifications. They include adding LED lights, sound, and an extra button. The LED lights and sounds will play based on what happens in the outcome, and the button overides the whole code and opens the door. The light and sound is just for extra flash, but the other button is for the scenario where you recognize the guest, but the computer doesn't. This is my whole project and I am extremely proud of this.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone is the code of the project. I finished the connection bewteen the Arduino UNO and the Raspberry Pi. With the code finished, the raspberry pi can now register the button press, come in contact with the online AWS services, and tell the Arduino UNO to turn its servo motor. We ran into a lot of problems during this milestone, including altering the code to fit our specialized door lock. My next steps are modifications, some of which I plan to add LED lights, sound, and another button.

# First Milestone

My first milestone is the hardware of the project. I built the casing for the arduino UNO, and got it to open and close the door. We found that the kit did not include the right parts and screws, so we had to search ourselves for them. We eventually found that the bigger and longer screws helped a lot. One thing I need to change is the Arduino code. My next steps include finishing all the raspberry pi code and completing the project.

# Starter Project
My starter project was the TV-B-GONE. It was basically a device that could turn off most TVs in the world. The device consisted of a battery pack, and a circuit. When the you press the button on the device, the infrared LED lights would start flashing in a pattern that most TVs translate as "OFF." So that is how it works!
