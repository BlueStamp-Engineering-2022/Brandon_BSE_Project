# Facial Rekognition Door Lock
This door lock is able to recognise people that arrive at the front of your door. It will then take a photo and send it to my email. Read more to find out how I did it!

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone

My first milestone was building the hardware of the project. This includes screwing the 3D printed pieces together and implementing the motor so that it can push out and retract the door lock. The servo motor is connected to a wheel that will lock in with the ridges on the lock itself. Some of the problems at this stage were finding the right screws for the project, and knowing exactly where to place each of the parts. Some of my next steps include brushing up the code, and finding a way to connect the arduino with the raspberry pi.

# Starter Project
My starter project was the TV-B-GONE. It was basically a device that could turn off most TVs in the world. The device consisted of a battery pack, and a circuit. When the you press the button on the device, the infrared LED lights would start flashing in a pattern that most TVs translate as "OFF." So that is how it works!
